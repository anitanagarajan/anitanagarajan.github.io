I’m Anita Nagarajan, a freelance English-language editor. I offer academic (research) editing, copy editing, and proofreading services. Armed with a Master’s degree in Computer Science and a passion for languages, I focus on enabling clear, correct, and coherent communication.

When I’m not donning the editor’s hat, I’m exploring a new place or [writing about my travels](http://funderfulworld.com/).

Services Offered:

- For researchers: Copy editing and proofreading of research manuscripts and technical papers (Field of Specialization: Computer Science)
- For non-profit organizations: Copy editing and proofreading of newsletters, flyers, reports, and social media and website content.
